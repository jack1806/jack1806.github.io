Australia, also thumped in the group stage, wait for Saturday’s final.

But It’s Also Benefited Common Man<br>
<u>AmitAnand.Choudhary@timesgroup.com</u><br>
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said apprehensions of profiling of citizens on the basis of Aadhaar card data is a serious issue that needs examination but the court also cannot neglect benefits brought by the scheme to the common man by way of eliminating middlemen and welfare schemes reaching the beneficiaries.
“Profiling is a very serious issue and we have to engage our mind on that aspect. But equally important is that the government has been able to provide benefits to communities under the scheme. It allows doorstep delivery of services and benefits to people,” Justice D Y Chandrachud, part of a five-judge Constitution bench, said during the ongoing hearings related to pleas challenging the scheme. </td>

Washington: Pakistan’s spy agency ISI trained a terrorist involved in the attack on Kabul’s iconic Intercontinental Hotel in which over 20 people were killed, a top Afghanistan diplomat has alleged. The country’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Mahmoud Saikal, made the allegation in a tweet on Monday.
“Abdul Qahar, father of one of the terrorists involved in last week attack on #Kabul
Intercontinental Hotel, concedes his son was trained in Chaman of #Balochistan Province of #Pakistan by the Inter- Services Intelligence of Pakistan. Qahar is currently in custody of Afg authorities,” Saikal tweeted. The Kabul hotel strike was similiar to the terror attack on Taj and Oberoi Trident hotels in Mumbai in 2008. AGENCIES </td>

<u>Rebecca.Samervel@timesgroup.com</u><br>
Mumbai: A sessions court on Tuesday framed charges against actor Sooraj Pancholi of abetting the suicide of his girlfriend actor Jiah Khan in 2013. Pancholi, who was present in the court, pleaded not guilty. The trial is expected to begin on February 14.<br>
The charge of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the IPC attracts a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail. Pancholi’s lawyer Prashant Patil withdrew the discharge plea he had submitted earlier.<br>
On June 3, 2013, Jiah was found hanging in the bedroom of her Juhu flat, following which Sooraj was arrested and charged with abetment. He was later released on bail.<br>
In January 2014, the Mumbai police filed a 447-page chargesheet and alleged suicide. In July 2014, the Bombay HC transferred the probe to the CBI after Jiah’s mother Rabia alleged murder. But in December 2015, the CBI filed a chargesheet, ruling out murder. </td>

<i>TIMES NEWS NETWORK</i><br>
<u><h4>Mumbai</h4></u>A city plastic surgeon and avid biker died on Monday evening while riding his Triumph Thunderbird Storm through a district road near Surat. Dr Bijoy Methil (44), who was attached to leading hospitals in the city, swerved his powerful bike to avoid jaywalkers when it skidded and he was thrown across the divider.<br>
His fellow rider, Jay Shah, who was almost 3km behind, found him a few minutes later and took him to a hospital with the help of a few locals. But it took them more than 30 minutes to reach the nursing home, where he was declared dead on arrival. Onlookers told Jay that a heavy vehicle had hit Methil after he fell from his bike around 7.30pm.<br>
Biking enthusiasts on Tuesday said the accident underlined the lack of traffic sense among Indians as well as the poor conditions of most roads. Methil, who specialised in microvascular and cosmetic reconstruction, had taken up long-distance biking about four years ago. </td>
